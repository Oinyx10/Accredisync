# Accredisync
ps : E GOVERNANCE PROJECT FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS :
The problem is to design and develop a web based solution that can streamline, automate, and
standardize the data collection, verification, reporting, and document management process for
different accreditations processes like NAAC/NBA/NIRF/QS across departments and
stakeholders in an academic institution.
Features:
1. Modular dashboards for different stakeholders (admin, faculty, IQAC/NBA coordinators,
HODs).
2. Upload facility for supporting documents and evidences (PDFs, images, etc.).
3. Faculty-wise and department-wise data input forms (teaching-learning, research,
infrastructure, etc.)
4. Data validation, de-duplication, and export/import functionalities.
5. Dynamic search and filtrations based on requirements.
6. Criteria based Report generation
7. Should be scalable for multiple departments.
